<h1>üìä Survey Data Analysis</h1>

<p>This repository contains a Jupyter notebook focused on the analysis of survey data, exploring both descriptive and inferential statistics to derive meaningful insights.</p>

<h2>üîç Project Overview</h2>

<p>The analysis covers various aspects of survey data from students, including their academic performance, perception of course materials, and learning environment. The main objectives of this project are to understand the relationship between different variables and to identify areas of improvement in the educational process.</p>

<h3>üìÇ Key Sections</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Descriptive Analysis</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Frequency Analysis</strong>: Examines the distribution of student gender, CGPA, material sufficiency, and the adequacy of practical examples.</li>
      <li><strong>Mode Analysis</strong>: Evaluates the relevance of assignments, the impact of the working environment on performance, and classroom conditions.</li>
      <li><strong>Percentage Analysis</strong>: Investigates the prevalence of soft skills among students and the perceived relevance of courses to job readiness.</li>
      <li><strong>Cross Tabulation</strong>: Analyzes relationships between variables, such as the impact of gender on CGPA and the correlation between doctor and assistant cooperation.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  
  <li><strong>Inferential Statistics</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Chi-Square Test</strong>: Tests the significance of relationships between categorical variables, including gender and GPA, and the effectiveness of interactive teaching techniques.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><strong>Correlation Analysis</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Measures the correlation between categorical variables to understand their relationships.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>üìà Results & Insights</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Gender and Academic Performance</strong>: The analysis indicates that gender may influence CGPA, with females generally having higher GPAs.</li>
  <li><strong>Interactive Teaching</strong>: There is evidence that interactive teaching techniques positively impact student outcomes.</li>
  <li><strong>Material Sufficiency</strong>: Students perceive that there are not enough practical examples, and course materials could be clearer.</li>
</ul>

<h2>‚öôÔ∏è How to Use</h2>
